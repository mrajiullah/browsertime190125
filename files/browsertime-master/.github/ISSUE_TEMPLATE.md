<!--
Thanks for reporting issues back to Browsertime!

We are going to take a long vacation this year again to recharge and make sure we can make sitespeed.io even better this autumn. What does this mean? We will not answer issues within 8 hours that we usually do, but don’t be scared: If we get any important bugs, we will fix them. And we will do maintenance releases when there’s a new Chrome/Firefox. And if you want a change, send us a PR :) https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io#vacation-july---august

Make sure you run the latest stable version, we move quite fast and fixes things.

To make it possible for us to help you please explain carefully how we can reproduce your problem. PLEASE give us the exact example how you are running (mask out passwords and URLs you don't want them to be public, but real URLS helps us a lot). Do you use Docker or npm? What is your base OS?
